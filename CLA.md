# Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for SuperSwiftMarkup Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SuperSwiftMarkup projects, developed and owned by Colbyn Wadman ("Owner"). The purpose of this Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions of software from any person or entity ("Contributor") to the SuperSwiftMarkup projects. This Agreement protects both the Contributor and the Owner and ensures that the Owner can monetize and license the projects as necessary.

The Owner is the copyright holder of the SuperSwiftMarkup projects, including but not limited to the SuperSwiftMarkdownPrototype project, as indicated in the license files distributed with the software.

By signing this Agreement, you and the Owner accept and agree to the following terms and conditions:

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"Contributions"** means all past, present, and future contributions of object code, source code, documentation, or other materials submitted by you to the SuperSwiftMarkup projects. Contributions exclude any submissions explicitly marked by you in writing as "Not a Contribution."

---

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Owner a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable copyright license to use, reproduce, execute, modify, prepare derivative works of, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions (internally and externally) in both object code and, if included in your Contributions, source code form. This grant includes the right to sublicense these rights as necessary to license or distribute the Projects under any license model chosen by the Owner, including but not limited to dual licensing under AGPLv3 and commercial terms.

Except for the rights expressly granted to the Owner in this Agreement, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent that:

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
2. If your employer(s) or another entity has rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to make Contributions on their behalf, or they have waived such rights for your Contributions to the SuperSwiftMarkup projects.
3. Unless otherwise disclosed in your Contribution submission(s), each of your Contributions is your original creation.
4. You have disclosed any applicable license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property) associated with any part of your Contributions.
5. You will notify the Owner of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, unless you choose to do so. Your Contributions are provided "as-is," without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

---

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall you be liable to the Owner or any other party for any damages arising from or related to this Agreement, your Contributions, or the use of your Contributions, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.

---

## 6. Additional Terms

This Agreement does not supersede or replace any open source license that applies to the Projects, including the AGPLv3. Rather, it ensures that the Owner has the necessary rights to manage and monetize the Projects effectively while protecting the Contributorâ€™s rights.
