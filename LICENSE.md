# SuperSwiftMarkup Projects License Agreement

This License Agreement ("Agreement") applies to all software collectively referred to as the SuperSwiftMarkup projects ("Projects"), developed and owned by Colbyn Wadman ("Owner").

## 1. Overview
The Projects are distributed under a dual licensing model. Users may choose to use the Projects under either:

1. The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 ("AGPLv3"); or
2. A commercial license, as specified in this Agreement.

By using any of the Projects, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions of either the AGPLv3 or the commercial license, depending on the license you select.

## 2. AGPLv3 License

Unless a commercial license has been purchased, the Projects are provided under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. A copy of the AGPLv3 can be found at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html.

### Key Terms of the AGPLv3 License:
- You are free to use, modify, and distribute the Projects, provided that any derivative works are also licensed under the AGPLv3.
- If you deploy the Projects, modified or unmodified, in a network-accessible manner, you must make the complete source code of the Projects, including any modifications, available to users.
- The AGPLv3 does not permit proprietary use without making source code publicly available.

## 3. Commercial License

For users or organizations who wish to use the Projects without complying with the AGPLv3â€™s requirements (e.g., for proprietary or closed-source projects), a commercial license is available.

### Commercial License Terms:
- The commercial license grants the right to use the Projects without the obligation to release source code or modifications under the AGPLv3.
- The license is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and valid for the duration agreed upon at the time of purchase.
- Pricing and specific terms are determined on a case-by-case basis.
